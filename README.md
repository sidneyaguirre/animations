# Flutter Animations

Animations are an important part in modern applications.
They make the app intuitive, natural and provides feedback to whats happening under the hood according to the interactions from the user.

Animations can be fun and creative, but most importantly the have to be functional/useful to the user. 

In this project you will find several implementations of Implicit and Explicit animations. like, 

- A form that has been divided by pages (mobile scenario) and displays a progress bar
- The use of a Hero animation
- Page Transition animation
- Content Slide animation
- A cursor trail animation
